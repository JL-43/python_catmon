A familiar, but slightly different tone rings out

--Opening monologue
"Welcome to the world of Catmon!
Around 5 years ago, cats suddenly evolved to have special powers and we observed them to use it on one another
They suddenly were able to breathe fire, create thunderstorms, and generate giant glaciers, among other things
Funnily enough though, these moves didn't really affect the world and the cats in any harmful way
As if these powers were just superficial and aesthetic
Of course, they would still sting a little bit and so cats would often use these on each other to scare them off their territory
Or decide who has the claim to the canned tuna on the street.
Eventually though, people who owned these cats decided that we can have them harmlessly play with each other for competition
This is what's known as a catmon battle

--- add part of the monologue where you pick your catmon

The world of cats is vast
And your journey finally about to start"

You leave the arcade that you were just playing at by yourself

You lost every race that you played on the racing simulator

"Oh well"

Cars pass the road in front of you, you have the option to walk either left or right coming from the arcade

Walking left takes you towards your home/neighborhood

Walking right takes you towards the city, going through here though you will find that there is a police blockade that won't let you through into the city.

They say that there is a cat stuck up in the tree and doesn't want to come down

He's so scared he's shooting little fire/water/seed pellets at people--it doesn't really hurt, of course, but the little kitty is scaring people off of the sidewalk

This forces us to walk towards our neighborhood

We get introduced to our dad (wholesome)

"Hey son, how was your trip to the arcade?"

"It was alright dad. Didn't win any of the races but got close though"

"Well, you've always been one to keep doing things until you got it down, I'm sure you'll get a hang of it soon--how'd your job interview yesterday go by the way?"

"Ah, well, I don't think it really went too well. They were talking about how they would rather have some experience dealing with cats.

"But wasn't the job you were applying for an IT job?"

"Yep."

"What do the cats have to do with it?", your dad chuckles

"More of a culture fit kind of thing"

"Oh--times really are kind of strange now, huh, son.
Well, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it soon too", he gives you a big grin

"Thanks dad", you smile back

"I heard there was a sale in the supermarket near the city today for meat. Why don't you go get us some sukiyaki meat and I'll make some of your favorite tonight?"

"Sure, dad"

Received Sukiyaki money

"Oh, and here son, I have some left over tuna sandwich. You probably haven't eaten yet, have you?

Received Left-over Tuna Sandwich

"Thanks" you grin

You make your way to the supermarket that is towards the city, right past the police barricade actually

--create section that introduces you to the catmon you selected in the screen earlier (same cat that was in the tree) and you give it your tuna sandwich
